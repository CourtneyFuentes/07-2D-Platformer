# 07-2D-Platformer

Project 7 for my C220 class at Indiana University Bloomington.
A 2D platform game made on Godot. "Zero Runs"

You are a dog, named Zero, and you must get to the tennis ball at the end of each level. Collect treats for a higher score. In the first level you will encounter enemy fleas, you may either jump  on the fleas to kill them or avoid them to avoid death. In the second level you will encounter enemy fleas and chocolate, you can only avoid chocolate, as jumping on chocolate does not make it any less harmful to dogs. Once you reach the end you will be told how many times you died and your total score. Move with WASD, jumping with either w or a space bar.
