# 07-2D-Platformer

Project 7 for my C220 class at Indiana University Bloomington.
A 2D platform game made on Godot. "Zero Runs"

You are a dog, named Zero, and you must get to the tennis ball at the end of each level. Collect treats for a higher score, and avoid/jump on enemy fleas to avoid death. There are two levels, once you reach the end you win. Move with WASD, jumping with either w or a space bar.
